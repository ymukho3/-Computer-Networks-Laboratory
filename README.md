# -Computer-Networks-Laboratory
This course provided hands-on experience with various network configurations and protocols. I learned to set up and monitor LANs, configure routers with static and dynamic routing (RIP, IGRP, OSPF, BGP), manage access lists, and work with VLANs. I also gained experience in IPv6 configuration, packet sniffing, and understanding DNS, which enhanced my practical knowledge of network management and security.
